## 🚀 About the Project

The Project Cost Calculator is a simple yet powerful application that showcases the synergy of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It calculates the cost of projects based on hours worked and price per hour, providing an efficient way to track project profits.

One of the key features of this application is its use of the `localStorage`, which allows it to persist data across browser sessions. This means that your project data will still be there even if you close and reopen your browser!
